Before You Begin
================

.. note::
    When setting up :mod:`django_flex_user`, it's ideal if your Django project is pre-production (i.e. you can safely
    delete and re-create your database tables).

    Due to various implementation details of Django, it's significantly more difficult to set up :mod:`django_flex_user`
    mid-project.
