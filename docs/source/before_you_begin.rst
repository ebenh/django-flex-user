Before You Begin
================

.. note::
    This guide assumes you're setting up :mod:`django_flex_user` with a brand new Django project (i.e. right after
    running :djadmin:`startproject` and before applying any migrations).

    Due to implementation details of Django, it's significantly more difficult to set up :mod:`django_flex_user`
    mid-project.
