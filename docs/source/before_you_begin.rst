Before You Begin
================

.. note::
    This guide assumes you're setting up :mod:`django_flex_user` with a brand new Django project.

    Due to implementation details of Django, it's significantly more difficult to set up :mod:`django_flex_user`
    mid-project.

    If you wish to set up :mod:`django_flex_user` with an existing Django project, see :ref:`auth-custom-user` for more
    details.
